THIS IS A Repo cloned from 
https://github.com/ais-lab/pl2map


run this in the terminal to install

git clone https://github.com/ais-lab/pl2map.git
cd pl2map
git submodule update --init --recursive
conda create --name pl2map python=3.9
conda activate pl2map
# Refer to https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/ to install pytorch compatible with your CUDA
python -m pip install torch==1.12.0 torchvision==0.13.0 
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Notes: 
deeplsd or pytlsd may not install properly. 
If that happen, install them manually using pip.
deeplsd weights installation links is broken, use the provided weights on my github repo or download from here https://github.com/cvg/DeepLSD?tab=readme-ov-file

! IMPORTANT, NEED TO UNINSTALL datasets to avoid name conflict.
After installing all the dependencies and libs


run these commands in terminal to isntall data.
./prepare_scripts/seven_scenes.sh
./prepare_scripts/cambridge.sh 
./prepare_scripts/indoor6.sh




Run this install pretrained model
./prepare_scripts/download_pre_trained_models.sh

Run this for evalution 
cuda device can be any valid number

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=7 python runners/eval.py --dataset Cambridge --scene OldHospital -expv pl2map

Note that this will show no visualization. 
If you have a local computer you can set the visualization parameters to true in runners/eval.py.
If not, gebru or jupyter does no support visualization.


Need to save ply file
I modified help_evaluation file. In class vis_info,update function, I commented out all the line of code that requires graphics window, and leave only code that save data.
put the modified help_evaluation.py in pl2mal/util

! IMPORTANT.
NEED TO create a folder called visualization in pl2map folder.


If youw want to run using jupyter notebook, I create a jupyter notebook, which takes the majority of code from eval.py in runners. I made some modification regarding the path to make it works. Install the jupyter noteobook and put it INSIDE the runners folder
